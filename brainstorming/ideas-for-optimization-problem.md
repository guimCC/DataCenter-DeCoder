## What to optimize for? (what is the objective function?)

* We could have multiple things we have to optimize for (e.g. min. water connection & max. Processing)
  * minimize for aX + (1-a)Y, where a \in [0, 1]


## Give subobtimal results

* We want to give some different results to the user, so he can choose the one he likes more (maybe one prioritizes more something rather than the other)


## Optimize for server location (?)
